# Car Sales Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a car sales dataset. The analysis includes cleaning the data, statistical summaries, and visualizations to understand various factors influencing car prices.

## Overview

The code explores a dataset that includes information about cars, such as their model, year, price, transmission, mileage, fuel type, tax, and engine size. It performs EDA to uncover insights into the relationships between these features and the prices of cars.

## Prerequisites

To execute the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Instructions

1. **Dataset**: Kaggle
2. **Run**: Execute the Python script to perform data analysis and generate visualizations.
3. **Observations**: Review the printed dataset information, summaries, and visualizations to gain insights.

## Analysis Steps

- Loads the dataset and displays basic information, such as the dataset structure and top/bottom rows.
- Cleans the data by removing specific entries based on criteria (e.g., filtering out specific car models or incorrect years).
- Visualizes relationships between car features and prices using various charts (scatter, bar, count plots).
- Presents statistical descriptions of the dataset and individual feature counts.

## Usage

Feel free to use this code as a starting point for your own analysis. You can modify the code to fit your specific dataset or add new visualizations for deeper insights.

## Contributions

Contributions to enhance the analysis or add new functionalities are welcome. Fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
